<p>This is my first public blog post other than some test posts I made to demo <a href="https://www.gohugo.com">Hugo</a>. Well, to be 100% accurate I used to run a non-public blog with <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">lb</a>. This was back before I bought a domain and started a website for real.</p>
<p>Hugo is a breeze. I had a little difficulty at first because I was running Hugo through the <code>hugo server</code> command. It seems like a bad idea in retrospect. I already have nginx, so why would I want another web server just to do what Nginx already does?</p>
<p>So now I update my site with the <code>hugo</code> command and serve my website via nginx. It doesn&rsquo;t auto-detect changes like <code>hugo server</code> but maybe there&rsquo;s a workaround?</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to continue tinkering with Hugo. If I ever revive my youtube channel this will be where I put any show notes.</p>
